This is the source code of the [CP] Ohodavi's Portraits for Ms. Qi mod, so some development stuff might be left in here. 
Expect a lot of placeholders and notes left that will not be present in the NexusMods upload.

Also the name of the mod folder in the source.zip should be [CP] Ohodavi's Portraits for Ms. Qi not MsQiPortraitMod-(versionnumber).zip but I can't figure out
and am too lazy to change it.

Reminder that mods are loaded in alphabetically, so if the mod does not work, try renaming it to be above any other portrait mod. 
I may add a portrait switcher later.
